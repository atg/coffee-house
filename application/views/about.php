	<h2>About the SugarStore</h2>
	<p><a href="http://www.macrabbit.com/espresso/">Espresso</a> is a powerful app. Let's <em>extend the power</em> with sugars and themes. The SugarStore is the right place to find these extensions. You can submit your own sugar or theme and <?=anchor('submit', 'be part of the library')?>.</p>
	<p>Hosting your sugar on Github? Great, while you can commit new versions, the download link always directs to the newest version.</p>
	<p>Developer? Implement the library in your own app using the <?=anchor('dev/xml','XML stream')?>. The entries are ordered by name. If you want them to be ordered by date so the new files are on the top, use <?=anchor('dev/xml/by_date','this stream')?>.</p>
	<p>This project is non commercial, it's just a great library based on MySQL and PHP 5.</p>
